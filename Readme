Coding Challenge - Stock Price Profit calculator
**************************************************

The function 'getMaxProfit' takes in a list of stock prices and calculates the best profit that could have been made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of the stock.
The possible return values are -

1. 0 meaning not enough indices to make a trade.
2. -1 meaning profitable trade not possible.
3. Result > 0 meaning the best profit possible.

Unit tests are in place to validate some scenarios.

Performance wise, this method does a full traversal of the list in the worst case scenario. ie the running time would be O(n)



Comments/Assumptions
----------------------

* Since the function is meant to process the indexes for 1 day in minutes (max indices 1440), this approach works well. There is a unit test to validate this scenario.
* Arguably the stock prices could be represented using BigDecimal, open for discussion
